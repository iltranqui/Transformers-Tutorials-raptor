# BERT notebooks

BERT is the model that gave birth to the Transformers library. It still is a widely used model for text-classification, named-entity recognition, extractive question answering, and more.

This folder contains some notebooks to fine-tune BERT for named-entity recognition (NER) and multi-label text classification.
